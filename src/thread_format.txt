##Scoring system

+2 points for correct result (Win Draw Loss)

+3 points for correct scoreline (exact)

+1 point for correct goal+scorer (applies to everyone regardless of accuracy of result, explained fully below)

-1 point for every incorrect goal+scorer if predicting us to score 5 or more and if we actually don't score at least 5

+5 points for overall winner (minute of first goal only used as tiebreaker, not worth any points)

+3 points in event of losing to a tiebreak

***

For the +1 for scorer, if you predicted 3 -1 win with Rashford, Greenwood, Pogba, and we win 4-0 with Rashford getting 2, Pogba 1 and Shaw 1, you get:

2 points for correct result

1 point for Rashford (you only predicted him to score once)

1 point for Pogba

2+1+1 = 4 points total
